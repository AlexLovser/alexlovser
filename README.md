## ABOUT

Backend software engineer with 5 years of commercial experience. Worked on various teams of 2–40 members as both an individual contributor and a team lead (remote & on-site). Experienced in the full development cycle: from gathering owner’s requirements to delivering high-load reliable products with automated CI/CD pipelines. Skilled at building innovative services, building greenfield projects to production, and evolving them until they work flawlessly. In addition, I am interested in AI/ML technologies and their application across a wide range of domains. One of my hobbies is publishing articles about the evolution of Artificial Intelligence on my LinkedIn page and the latest tools built on it. I have been developing a mobile ecosystem application with integrated AI for my university for over 2 years. This application is designed to help students access support and information easily.
